# AND101 Project 4 - CodeMath - BMI Calculator

Submitted by: **Jaydon Antoine**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Summary

**BMI Calculator** is an android app that **calculates the users Body Mass Index (BMI) based on the weight (lbs) and height (in) inputed.**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üßÆüí™üèæüß¨**

## Notes

I learned quite a bit in this lesson. For one, I learned that, as good as it may sound, ChatGPT is not good at giving advice and/or debugging code.
After struggling for a bit, I found that many of the answers I needed were solved simply by looking through documentation or by looking at examples on Stack Overflow.
In addition, I learned a little more about the detail orientedness of Android Studio, such as the specific folder that images need to be saved into in order to be properly imported, the need to say 'viewbinding = true' and not just 'viewbinding true' (despite claims otherwise),
and other such tiny details.
